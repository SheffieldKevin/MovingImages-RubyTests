# MovingImages-RubyTests
The system tests written in ruby for end to end testing of the MovingImages Launch Agent

### Running tests from the command line

If you haven't already done so, you will need to install the MovingImages. This is done with the MovingImages application.

To run all tests then run the command runtests. Each test script file is independent and can be run seperately.
